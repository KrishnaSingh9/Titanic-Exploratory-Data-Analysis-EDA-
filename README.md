# Titanic-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
In this notebook, we're going to analyse the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. We're only going to do some exploratory data analysis(EDA) at this stage.  We'll try to answer the following questions: - Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (age, gender, class.. etc) - What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class? - Where did the passengers come from? - Who was alone and who was with family? - What factors helped someone survive the sinking?
